# Dialogflow to Rasa Migration Tool

## Overview
The script is a tool for migrating chatbot data from Dialogflow to Rasa 3, specifically handling intents and entities by converting JSON files from Dialogflow into YAML files for Rasa. 

## Usage
Follow these steps to migrate your Dialogflow chatbot to Rasa:

### 1. Prepare Dialogflow Files
Export your Dialogflow agent and place the `agent.json`, `package.json`, along with the `entities` and `intents` folders in the `dialogflow` directory.

### 2. Initialize Rasa Project
Run the command `rasa init` to initialize a new Rasa project in the `rasa` folder. This folder will be the destination for the migration output (Rasa files).

### 3. Modify Domain Configuration
Ensure the `rasa/domain.yml` reflects desired session configuration immediately after the `version` line, as shown below:
```yaml
version: "3.1"
session_config:
  session_expiration_time: 60
  carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true

intents:
  - greet
```

### 4. Clean Stories File
The rasa/stories.yml should start empty to avoid warnings during training:
```yaml
version: "3.1"

stories:
```

### 5. Execute Migration Script
Run the migration script with the command:
   $ python DialogRasaMigrator.py

### 6. Update Configuration
Review and adjust the rasa/config.yml as necessary for your project's needs.

### 7. Train Your Rasa Model
Navigate to Rasa project directory and execute rasa train to generate model.

### 8. Troubleshooting
Refer to `TroubleshootingDialogflowToRasa.pdf` for common errors and warnings.
